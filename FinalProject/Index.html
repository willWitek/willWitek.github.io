            Suits exist, but most people either think they're uncomfortable, mystical, or off-limits in some other way. I like them. I think they're interesting.
            I want to be able to share knowledge that I've gained over a few years of reading and learning about the history of tailoring in classical menswear,
            and I want to present that knowledge in a very slick website. The title is a nod to the Kingsman films, which recently brought savile row tailoring back 
            into the mainstream.
