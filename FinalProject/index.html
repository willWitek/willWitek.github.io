                <h3>The Story of the Suit</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                The term “suit” is derived from the French term <em>suivre</em>, which means “to follow.” In other words, the jacket follows the pants--so a suit is a combination of a jacket and a pair of pants in a matching fabric. It’s not just the color of the garments that is the same, but also the fabric composition. The combination of a matching jacket, trousers, and waistcoat have been in and out of fashion since the 17th Century. In the early 19th century, British dandy Beau Brummell redefined, adapted, and popularized the style of the British court, leading European men to wearing well-cut, tailored clothes, adorned with carefully knotted neckties. Towards the end of the 19th century, the modern lounge suit was born as a very informal garment meant only to be worn for sports, in the country, or at the seaside. The lounge suit slowly became accepted outside of its leisurely origins, and by the beginning of the 20th century had become the default mens formalwear. Throughout the 20th century, the lounge suit has remained largely unchanged other than modifications to the cut as fashion sensibilities have changed over time.
