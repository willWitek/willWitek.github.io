              <h2>Origins</h2>
              <p>7U got its name as a play on <em>WWWU</em>, which stands for <em>World Wide Web University</em>. And truly, we have achieved that goal. Through state-of-the-art web 2.0 technology we have created a shared synergetic space for true total educational integration cross-platform and multi-level through a funneled narrow-lane datastream platform. Our founder, Skelon Brush, was offered $70 million in seed funding from Steff Crezos and he used this to personally build out the brand new 7.0 fireSnow architecture that 7U runs on. In addition, we have partnered with dozens of content creators from all over the world to deliver content seamlessly in 24 different languages, including native Esperanto and Lojban speakers.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission at 7U is guided by three core principles: <br><br>
                Clarity <br>
                Transparency <br>
                Brevity <br><br>
                These three key and unassailable goals of our company define and relate all our synchronized (and unsychronized) actions. Our Philosophy is to consistently and strongly re-integrate new and existing platforms of data transmission and transmutation to deliver content across a seamless integrated platform through continuous datastreams. For this reason, our content database is now open source through creative commons licensing which allows both contributors and non-contributors (with article 3a contributor status*) to download, poke around, modify, and improve our software. We have even gone so far as to make our hardware completely open source and open to the public to allow anybody to make direct modifications to our servers, regardless of their qualifications. Through this direct improvement method we have seen our site downtime drop by -500% (a real increase of 500% downtime). These numbers are truly astonishing. Our statistics are some of the most incredible in our field and industry. And that is why we have come to this point: our mission has been and always will be to increase, numerically and not otherwise or around the corner, the actual physical tactile brain area of children across the world. We believe that if we can simply increase the volume and surface area of the brains of children that we will eventually have sufficient excess human brain mass to develop various potions, tinctures, and remedies to fight crime and seasonal allergies. If you believe in our mission, like we believe in our mission, please, put some money in an envelope and mail it to us. Skelon Brush blew through our series-A funding money and made off to Thailand to put it all on black. You can find our contact information on the <em>contact</em> page.
