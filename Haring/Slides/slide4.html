                    -   Haring is considered to be part of the Contemporary Art Movement, although many of his ideas come from Pop Art because of his relationship with Andy Warhol.
                    <br><br>
                    -   He operated parallel to the early Club Kid scene in the 80s along with Basquiat, although they mostly worked in parallel with the Club Kids only occasionally dipping into that crowd.
                    <br><br>
                    -   Haring's biggest dip into that scene came in the form murals for various nightclubs like Club 57, Paradise Garage, and The Palladium.
