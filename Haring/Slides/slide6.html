                <p> -   Haring had friends who had struggled with addiction and he was unsatisfied with the government’s inaction, so he used his art to send a message.
                    <br><br>
                    -	He painted a bright orange mural reading “crack is wack” on a concrete handball court wall in Harlem River Park at 127th Street
                    <br><br>
                    -	“As he was wrapping up the final touches, police drove by and gave Haring a court summons for defacing public property (though the artist did not serve time in jail and ultimately paid a reduced fine of $25.) In the days that followed, the mural gained visibility as the media used its image in its coverage of the crack crisis. Eventually, it was vandalized by someone in the neighborhood, and NYC’s Parks Department responded by painting over it with a drab gray. But by that point, the mural’s existence and Haring’s summons had become public knowledge, and the Parks Department commissioner, lamenting its effacement, asked Haring if he would repaint it. Haring agreed, producing a two-sided mural this time, spelling his anti-drug message on both faces of the court wall and altering the original imagery.”
