                    -	Haring was uninterested in the high-class art gallery scene. His audience was young party-goers. Most of his exhibitions were at underground clubs and dance-halls, like Club 57.
                    <br><br>
                    -	Club 57 blurred the lines between gay and straight, highbrow and lowbrow, art and partying in daring and unprecedented ways. It was a space for creative minds to let loose and have fun
