            <h2>A Boy in Wisconsin</h2>
            <p>
                You watched my reaction to your story. <br><br>
                "I know a boy," I said, and paused. <br><br>
                Your eyebrows lifted. You waited. <br><br>
                "I know a boy in Wisconsin," I said, and faltered again. <br><br>
                I watched a small smile spread slowly over your face. <br><br>
                "Is there more to this story?" you asked me softly. <br><br>
                I stared at the ground, trying hard to hide my smile. "There might be." <br><br>
                You took my hand and I glanced up. There was a knowing smile on your face. And you waited for me to speak again. <br><br>
                "I hope there is," I said, barely above a whisper. <br><br>
                You smiled again and just walked quietly beside me. I think you were waiting for me to say more. But I didn't. Because there was too much to say and I didn't know how to start. <br><br>
                After a bit, you began to tell me more of your stories. But you didn't forget. I could see it in your eyes. Whenever I got quiet, you smiled at me. You told me a bit about Wisconsin. Said you'd been there before. Said it was pretty up north. <br><br>
                I hope you get to meet that boy in Wisconsin someday. He'd like you. <br><br>
