            <h2>Istanbul</h2>
            <p>
                Istanbul is wandering on my forehead <br>
                the seagulls are flying from my chest <br>
                the clouds of the longing on their eyes <br>
                the dream showers on my eyelashes <br><br>
                As I compose the poems of the sorrows <br>
                pile on my letters the greetings of the fellows <br>
                the pipes urges my heart <br>
                istanbul doesn’t shelter in my heart <br><br>
                What wraps my shoulders are the shawls of the separation <br>
                pours down on me the coolness of the night <br>
                you were crippled by how many bends that your wound doesn’t bleed <br>
                a light grabbles our memories <br><br>
                It is fall that caresses the hairs of our lives <br>
                when my eyes touch the tree on black and white <br>
                of a photograph, my mind is scattered <br>
                the leaves of the love surround my heart <br><br>
                My loneliness cut out from the cloth of the sorrow <br>
                is the pages of the summer, which are not closed <br>
                not death, a hope, what my tongue says, anyhow <br>
                wait for my youth, you are my longing oh istanbul. <br><br>
