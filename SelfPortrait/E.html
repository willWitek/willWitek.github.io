            <h2>Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802</h2>
            <p>
                Earth has not any thing to show more fair: <br><br>
                Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br><br>
                A sight so touching in its majesty:<br><br>
                This City now doth, like a garment, wear<br><br>
                The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,<br><br>
                Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie<br><br>
                Open unto the fields, and to the sky;<br><br>
                All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.<br><br>
                Never did sun more beautifully steep<br><br>
                In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;<br><br>
                Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!<br><br>
                The river glideth at his own sweet will:<br><br>
                Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;<br><br>
                And all that mighty heart is lying still!<br><br>
                -William Wordsworth
