            <h2>Malta Through My Eyes</h2>
            <p>
                Gazing down from my hotel balcony, a beautiful breath taking view, acres of landscaped gardens, flowers, trees of every colour and hue <br><br>

                My eyes travel over an azure blue bay. To a thousand coloured sunshades assaulting my mind <br><br>
                
                An ants nest of seething half naked humanity, burnt red and covered in oil. Surrounded by discarded bottles and cans and wrappers of ice cream stained foil <br><br>
                
                For a week they're going to lie there, bodies burned raw by the sun. Their idea of enjoyment, their idea of holiday fun <br><br>
                
                I have walked the length of those bright golden sands, smelt the stench of the stale cooking oil. It gives me no pleasure to linger here while I have the real Malta to enjoy <br><br>
                
                Beyond the human pollution the sand dwellers love a burnt barren ridge gainst the sky. And yet from this red brown earth an existence bis clawed by the strength of a strong Maltese hand <br><br>
                
                My gaze travels left to the beautiful church and the cream coloured town just beyond. The old and the new joined hand in hand where concrete marries natural stone <br><br>
                
                How many of the sand dwellers have enjoyed what this beautiful land can provide? Have they truly experienced this island, seen life on the other side? <br><br>
                
                In a few days they'll be up there flying back to the place they call home, but from what they experienced of Malta they might just have well been to the moon <br><br>
